## Andrew
* line length detection tool
  * v1 complete
  * working on chb01_03.edf at ~100s lag
* total area detection tool
  * v1 complete
* found dataset to use
  * http://www.physionet.org/pn6/chbmit/

## Ali
* simulate ECoG data
* explore Simulink strategy

## Shayan
* GUI design
* stimulation generation

## Unassigned
* ~~find ECoG data for seizures~~
* frequency/amplitude detection tool
* setting stimulation parameters based on user input
  * similar to how a clinician would increase values and set nominal settings to prevent false positive detections
* measure false positives, true positives, and false negatives
  * true negatives would just be no stim during regular ECoG
